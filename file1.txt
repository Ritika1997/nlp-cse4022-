Summer is a charming flirt. Easy-going and casual. Summer doesn.t huff and puff to win our affections. It has us at "Hellow". Winter broods like the tortured protagonist of big fat Russian novel. It is dauting and dramatic, burning with a slow intensity.
The season's reputation precedes itself,and ofteb, not in a good way. It has a way of whittling down everything to its bare bones. Even relationship not attuned to its ebbs and flows can fray. At a dinner conversation I once attended.I listened in bemusement as a recent divorcee made the case that it was the Scandinavian frost that had cooled his ex-wife's ardour. How original.
