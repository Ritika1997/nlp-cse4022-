If there is a phrase I would prefer to retire from online bios, personal and professional, it is, “I love travel.” Or some proximation of that sentiment. To clarify, I’m not against travelers and those who proudly flaunt their passion for travel. On the contrary, editing a travel magazine has now made me oddly protective of travelers and their ilk. My submission is that “ love to travel,” suggesting so casually, just doesn’t feel adequate to the depth of emotion it sparks in true devotees.
